# Contributing to Cone

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cone! There are many ways to contribute and we appreciate all of them.
Here is an incomplete list of possibilities:

- Language & Compiler:  Find bugs, fix bugs, suggest designs, or implement designed features.
- Tools:  Editor/IDE plug-ins, installation scripts, Congo build tool, package management, playground, linter, etc.
- Package Libraries
- Documentation:  Cone home page, reference documentation, etc. (including art design on layout, logos, etc.)

We want mutually-beneficial contributions: 
those that match your enthusiasm and skills to what will best fulfill Cone's vision for the future.
The only way to sort that out is by building a relationship with you, where we get to know each other
and decide together a mutually-enjoyable contribution plan, step-by-step.

The best way to get started is:

- Learn more about Cone from the https://cone.jondgoodwin.com website. 
  In addition to pages that describe Cone's key features, you will find:

  . A detailed reference guide to the language.
  . A playground you can use to learn Cone by doing, without having to install the compiler on your machine.
  . A blog whose posts provide helpful context on the rationale behind many of Cone's more intriguing features,
    as well as architectural design decisions for the compiler.
  
- Join the Cone community on Discord (see the link on the Cone homepage).
  Here you can ask questions, suggest improvements, build relationships, and explore ideas on where to contribute.
  
If you find bugs or have suggestions for improvement, 
we encourage you to create new Github issues followed later by Pull Requests (PRs).
The Discord server is the best place for questions, discussions, and building relationships and synergy.
